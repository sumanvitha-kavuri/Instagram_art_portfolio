      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>During my time in college, I worked as a <strong>Part-Time Portrait Artist</strong>, where I had the opportunity to hone my skills in creating detailed and expressive portraits. This experience taught me how to capture the nuances of human emotion and expression, refining my technique and attention to detail. Working with a variety of clients, I developed a deeper understanding of portraiture, which has become one of my strongest artistic specialties.</p>
