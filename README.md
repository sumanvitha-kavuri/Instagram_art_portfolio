The "Responsive Art Portfolio Website" project aims to bridge the gap between artistic creativity and digital technology by providing a platform where art meets functionality.
Aspiring artists often struggle to showcase their work effectively in the digital space, particularly through platforms that adapt seamlessly to various devices.
This gap limits the reach of their creations and potential collaborations.
This project resolves this challenge by delivering a fully responsive website built with HTML and CSS designed to present artwork in an engaging and professional manner.
The portfolio serves as a digital gallery for artworks inspired by themes like women, Indian culture, and history. 
The website ensures a smooth user experience across devices, allowing visitors to appreciate the art while exploring the creatorâ€™s journey and skills.

Technologies Used: HTMLC and CSS.
